## Phase 1: Backend Environment Setup

### Prompt 1.1: Initialize the Backend Project
_"Create a new folder named `backend` in the project root. Initialize a Python virtual environment and install the following packages: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-multipart`, `websockets`, `pydub`, `librosa`, `numpy`, `openai-whisper`, `nltk`, `spacy`. Provide installation instructions and a README.md for setup."_

### Prompt 1.2: Create a Basic FastAPI App
_"Generate a FastAPI application with a GET endpoint at `/` returning `{ "message": "Hello from Vocal Backend" }`. Include basic error handling and inline comments to explain the structure."_

---

## Phase 2: Real-Time Audio Streaming & WebSocket Integration

### Prompt 2.1: Implement WebSocket Endpoint
_"Write a FastAPI WebSocket endpoint at `/ws/audio`. The endpoint should:
- Accept multiple simultaneous connections.
- Receive audio data in small chunks from the client.
- Temporarily buffer the incoming audio data.
- Save the received data as a temporary `.wav` file for further processing.
Include robust error handling, connection management, and inline comments."_

### Prompt 2.2: Document WebSocket Connection Protocol
_"Produce documentation on how the client (Next.js) should establish and maintain a WebSocket connection with the backend. Include details on data formats (e.g., binary audio chunks), message structure, and error recovery protocols."_

---

## Phase 3: Speech-to-Text Transcription using OpenAI Whisper

### Prompt 3.1: Integrate OpenAI Whisper
_"Write a FastAPI endpoint or function that:
- Loads the temporary `.wav` audio file from the WebSocket stream.
- Processes the audio file using OpenAI Whisper to generate a text transcript.
- Returns the transcription along with word-level timestamps as a structured JSON object.
Ensure the code is asynchronous and includes error handling."_

---

## Phase 4: Audio Processing for Vocal Metrics

### Prompt 4.1: Extract Audio Features with Librosa & PyDub
_"Develop a Python function that:
- Loads the audio file using PyDub.
- Uses Librosa to extract key vocal features such as pitch (fundamental frequency), volume (RMS energy), and spectral characteristics.
- Computes metrics like average pitch, volume stability, and speaking rate (words per minute, calculated later with transcription).
Return a JSON object with these metrics and include detailed inline comments."_

---

## Phase 5: NLP for Filler Words, Stutters, and Sentiment

### Prompt 5.1: Filler Word Detection using NLP
_"Write a Python function that takes the transcription text as input and uses spaCy or NLTK to tokenize the text. Detect and count filler words (e.g., 'um', 'like', 'uh', 'you know') and return their count and positions in the text. Use regex where necessary to detect repeated patterns."_

### Prompt 5.2: Stutter Analysis
_"Develop a function to analyze the transcription for stutters (e.g., repeated words like 'I-I-I'). Use regex patterns and/or NLP tokenization to detect these stutters, and return a count along with sample occurrences."_

### Prompt 5.3: Sentiment and Emotional Tone Analysis
_"Create a function that analyzes the emotional tone of the transcribed text using a transformer model (e.g., DistilBERT or an OpenAI API endpoint). The function should classify the tone as 'confident', 'hesitant', 'nervous', or 'neutral' and provide a confidence score for the sentiment analysis."_

---

## Phase 6: Generating Personalized Feedback

### Prompt 6.1: Generate Feedback from Analysis
_"Write a function that combines the outputs from the audio feature extraction and NLP analyses to generate personalized coaching feedback. For example, if too many filler words are detected, advise the user to slow down and pause instead of filling space with 'um'. Return a human-like, motivational text message along with detailed metric summaries (JSON format)."_

---

## Phase 7: Frontend Integration with Next.js

### Prompt 7.1: Set Up Next.js Project and WebSocket Client
_"Create a Next.js project (if not already done) and set up a WebSocket client that connects to the backend’s `/ws/audio` endpoint. The client should:
- Capture live audio from the user's microphone using the Web Audio API.
- Convert the audio stream into small `.wav` chunks.
- Transmit these chunks over the WebSocket connection.
- Handle reconnection and error states gracefully."_

### Prompt 7.2: Build the Floating Orb UI
_"Design an interactive floating orb component using React and TailwindCSS in Next.js. When clicked, the orb should start recording audio. It should visually react (change colors, pulsate) based on real-time analysis feedback (e.g., red if filler words are detected, green for good pace). Include detailed animations and inline comments explaining the UI logic."_

### Prompt 7.3: Display Real-Time Feedback
_"Integrate a live feedback component that displays real-time analysis data received from the WebSocket. Update the UI dynamically with the transcription text, metrics (filler count, pitch, volume, sentiment), and personalized coaching tips."_

---

## Phase 8: User Authentication & Session Persistence

### Prompt 8.1: Integrate Supabase Authentication
_"Integrate Supabase Auth into the Next.js project to support email/password and social logins (Google, Apple). Provide a detailed guide for setting up Supabase, configuring environment variables, and handling user sessions."_

### Prompt 8.2: Store Speech Session Data in Supabase
_"Modify the FastAPI backend to, after processing an audio session, store the following data in a Supabase PostgreSQL database:
- User ID (from Supabase Auth)
- Timestamp of session
- Transcription text
- Audio analysis metrics (pitch, volume, filler counts, sentiment)
Generate a complete schema definition and SQL migration scripts as needed."_

### Prompt 8.3: Build a User Dashboard
_"Develop a Next.js dashboard that queries Supabase for a logged-in user's past speech sessions. Display historical data with interactive charts (e.g., progress over time, improvement in metrics) using a charting library such as Chart.js or Recharts."_

---

## Phase 9: Gamification, Monetization & User Retention

### Prompt 9.1: Implement Gamification Features
_"Design and implement a gamification system where users earn points, badges, or streaks based on their performance (e.g., reduced filler words, improved pitch variability). Provide a detailed UI component in Next.js to show daily challenges, achievements, and progress metrics. Include backend endpoints to update and retrieve gamification data."_

### Prompt 9.2: Integrate Subscription and Monetization (Stripe)
_"Integrate Stripe into the Next.js frontend to offer a freemium model:
- Free users get basic feedback.
- Premium subscribers receive advanced insights and personalized coaching.
Create a subscription flow with checkout pages and secure API endpoints on the backend for handling payments and managing subscription statuses."_

---

## Phase 10: Deployment & Monitoring

### Prompt 10.1: Deploy the FastAPI Backend
_"Write a deployment guide for the FastAPI backend using Railway, Fly.io, or Heroku. Include instructions for setting environment variables, configuring CORS, and ensuring that the WebSocket server is production-ready."_

### Prompt 10.2: Deploy the Next.js Frontend
_"Provide detailed steps for deploying the Next.js frontend to Vercel, including configuration for environment variables (backend URL, Supabase keys) and optimizations for production builds."_

### Prompt 10.3: Set Up Monitoring and Analytics
_"Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry for error tracking, LogRocket for user session replay) into the Next.js frontend. Also, configure PostgreSQL performance monitoring on Supabase. Document the integration process with detailed inline comments."_

## Final Steps & Future Enhancements

### Prompt 11.1: Final Testing & QA
_"Create a comprehensive test suite for both the backend and frontend:
- Unit tests for individual audio processing functions and NLP analysis.
- Integration tests for WebSocket communication.
- End-to-end tests simulating user sessions.
Generate documentation for running tests and setting up CI/CD pipelines."_

### Prompt 11.2: Roadmap for Future Enhancements
_"Document potential improvements, such as:
- Advanced AI coaching using real-time conversational agents.
- Mobile app conversion or PWA features.
